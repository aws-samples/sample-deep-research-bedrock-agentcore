# Requirements for testing scripts (local development only)
# Updated: 2024-10-29

# AWS SDK for Lambda invocation and Secrets Manager
# Using >= to allow compatible updates
boto3>=1.40.0,<2.0.0

# Note: Most testing can be done with just boto3 using:
#   - aws lambda invoke (direct Lambda testing)
#   - aws logs tail (CloudWatch logs)
#   - aws secretsmanager get-secret-value

# Optional: Only needed for advanced Gateway MCP protocol testing
# If you want to test Gateway directly with test-gateway.py, uncomment:
# mcp>=1.19.0,<2.0.0
# httpx>=0.28.0,<1.0.0
